# oTree App for Bargaining in Standing Committees with an Endogeneous Status Quo
### Salvatore Nunnari, Bocconi University, salvatore.nunnari@unibocconi.it

This repository contains two oTree apps:

* **dbarg**: dynamic legislative bargaining with three players and endogenous status quo
as in the experiments by Battaglini, Marco and Thomas R. Palfrey, 2012, "The Dynamics of Distributive Politics" and Nunnari, 2019, "Veto Power in Standing Committees: An Experimental Study". This app implements a single instance of an infinitely repeated game (i.e., a single "match").

* **dbarg_multiple**: dynamic legislative bargaining with three players and endogenous status quo as in the experiments by Battaglini, Marco and Thomas R. Palfrey, 2012, "The Dynamics of Distributive Politics" and Nunnari, 2019, "Veto Power in Standing Committees: An Experimental Study". This app implements multiple instances of an infinitely repeated game (i.e., multiple "matches").

These apps were developed with oTree version 2.1.35.
